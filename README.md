This work is based on a project from the Data Analyst Nanodegree of Udacity.
The goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the
similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature
trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, i followed the
steps below:

   Extract the data from the database.
   I needed to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the city i want to show.

       Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
       Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.

   Create a line chart that compares my cities temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average
   rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.
   Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my cities averages, as well as overall trends.

Submission

Your submission should be a PDF that includes:

   An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
       What tools did i use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
       How did i calculate the moving average?
       What were my key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
   Line chart with local and global temperature trends
   At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends

   You can find the result as pdf and as jupyter notebook
